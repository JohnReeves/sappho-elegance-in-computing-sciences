# Foregrounding myself

Obvious to me:   
"John, you are remarkably niaive about people"
emotions, behaviour & thoughts.

What do I have to share?
Variety needs variety & the shallow Q-curve!   
My elephant in the room!

a fractured lens;   
(to compare to the network of roots, and   
 to the fractured container)

not a capitalist business plan; and   
not a technical report; 
nor yet a balanced argument of plausibility .  

hostility in engineering: everybody is suffering (blacks, whites, women);   
social justice in engineering: thw wildwest mentality (ibm, google, elon musk);   
trade warfare in engineering: destruction of industruction of industries (tsr2, radar, education, government);   
best practice in engineering: asset stripping land, products and people;   

the absolute numbers not the ratios;  
building a community; and .  
the daily fight for democracy.   
not your job to teach me.   
(except when it is)

educationalists, sociologists & psychologist should hold us to account!

- i am someone different for each person;   
- i am overwhelmed in groups;   
- i am overwhelmed by strangers;  
- i am underwhelmed by distance;   
- i care deeply.

* endure, sustain, love & thrive;   
* do what you can until you can do what you want;

* Aristotle points at her but explains nothing;   
* educational philosophy is like the story mountain;   
* tells the finished product and doesn't creativity.   

# The Art of Scientific Computing

As so often happens when I come to an end of research:
I sit back and wonder - what's so special about that; 
could I have reached the same conclusion if I have just
turned the other way!

In this case, I have:
learned a body of knowledge on classroom teaching;   
adjusted my thinking and behaviour in dealing with people;   
looked anew at the behaviour of technology companies and the state;   
but so what?   

I can't deny it has been hard work - 
overturning a lifetime of learning mathematics and physical sciences; 
overcoming neurological handicaps; 
making up for atrophying skills; and 
dealing with other peoples lack of 
appreciation.

What is there in all of that that warrents sharing with other people?

Living educational theory asks for an improvement in my influence in the groups I am part of.

That seems like a very power oriented thinking tracing back through Dewey to Aristotle. However, Dewey is less than honest in his description of the myriad of women in his own development; and Aristotle's acceptance of Sappho is lost to time.

You don't have to search very far to find Aristotle's description of Sappho as the 10th muse, so accepted as part of the classical framework of knowledge that he goes no further.

In our times that seems a filterning of knowledge worth sharing.

# cultivation of charis (grace elegance) and thelxis (enchartment, charm)

I am currently reading and reflecting Sappho into my experience and interactions in computer science.

After my dissatisfaction with Dewey (mansplaining, manwashing, liberal elitism)

## research plan

* plain text description for the university   
* bootstrap version because it's a nice idea   
* react version because it's something to learn   

# basic plan

* literature review .  
* develop & focus the research question .  
* design & complete a pilot study .  
* write a transfer proposal .  

# section titles

* Research Question .  
* Context .  
* Methodology .  
* Pilot Study . 

# academic guidance

* foreground yourself . 
* critical review of the literature .  
* pilot study / conext of women & children & academic research .  
* build an academic relationship with the university .  

# academic records

* meeting agenda & notes .  
* progress reports .  
* academic writing for review .  
* blog journalling for public consumption .  
* record keeping for portfolio management .
